        <h2 id="ai-services">6. AI Services &amp; Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>Our platform uses artificial intelligence to power several features. Please be aware of the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>AI is not perfect.</strong> AI-generated content (quotes, responses, scheduling decisions) may contain errors. You are responsible for reviewing AI outputs before they are sent to your customers or used for business decisions.</li>
          <li><strong>Voice AI disclosure.</strong> If you use the AI Receptionist, we recommend informing callers that they are speaking with an AI assistant, in compliance with applicable laws.</li>
          <li><strong>Quote accuracy.</strong> Instant Quotes are estimates generated based on the data you configure and the information customers provide. They are not binding contracts. You are responsible for final pricing.</li>
          <li><strong>Review responses.</strong> AI-drafted review responses are suggestions. We do not post responses on your behalf without your explicit approval.</li>
          <li><strong>No professional advice.</strong> AI outputs do not constitute legal, financial, medical, or other professional advice.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="legal-highlight">
          <p><strong>Your responsibility:</strong> You maintain full control and responsibility for how AI tools interact with your customers. We provide the technology; you are responsible for its appropriate use in your business context.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="ip">7. Intellectual Property</h2>

        <h3>Our Property</h3>
        <p>The Remodely AI platform, including its software, design, features, documentation, and branding, is owned by Remodely AI LLC and protected by intellectual property laws. Your subscription grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Service during your subscription period.</p>

        <h3>Custom Work</h3>
        <p>If we create custom configurations, integrations, or features specifically for your business under a separate agreement, ownership of that custom work transfers to you upon full payment, unless otherwise specified. We retain the right to use general knowledge, techniques, and non-proprietary components developed during the engagement.</p>

        <h3>Feedback</h3>
        <p>If you provide feedback, suggestions, or feature requests, you grant us a perpetual, royalty-free license to use that feedback to improve our platform, without any obligation to you.</p>

        <h2 id="data-ownership">8. Your Data</h2>
        <p>You retain ownership of all data you input into the platform ("Your Data"), including business information, client lists, pricing configurations, and communications.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We will not access Your Data except to provide the Service, troubleshoot issues with your permission, or comply with the law.</li>
          <li>We will not sell Your Data to third parties.</li>
          <li>Upon account cancellation, you may request an export of Your Data within 30 days. After 30 days, Your Data will be permanently deleted from our systems.</li>
          <li>Our use of Your Data is further governed by our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="confidentiality">9. Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>We treat your business data as confidential. We will not disclose your proprietary business information (pricing strategies, client lists, internal processes) to third parties except:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>As necessary to provide the Service (e.g., sending data to Stripe for payment processing).</li>
          <li>With your explicit consent.</li>
          <li>As required by law, regulation, or legal process.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="warranties">10. Warranties &amp; Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>The Service is provided <strong>"as is"</strong> and <strong>"as available"</strong> without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>
        <p>We do not warrant that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components.</li>
          <li>AI-generated outputs will be accurate, complete, or suitable for your specific needs.</li>
          <li>The Service will meet all of your business requirements.</li>
          <li>Any defects will be corrected within a specific timeframe.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We strive for high availability and aim for 99.9% uptime, but we do not guarantee it. Scheduled maintenance windows will be communicated in advance when possible.</p>

        <h2 id="liability">11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Remodely AI shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, data, business opportunities, or goodwill.</li>
          <li>Our total liability for any claims arising from or related to the Service shall not exceed the total amount you paid us in the 12 months preceding the claim.</li>
          <li>We are not liable for damages arising from your reliance on AI-generated content, including inaccurate quotes, scheduling errors, or inappropriate responses.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or limitation of liability, so some of the above may not apply to you.</p>

        <h2 id="indemnification">12. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Remodely AI LLC, its officers, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) arising from:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your use of the Service.</li>
          <li>Your violation of these Terms.</li>
          <li>Your violation of any rights of a third party.</li>
          <li>Content you input into the platform or actions taken by AI tools configured by you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="termination">13. Termination &amp; Cancellation</h2>

        <h3>Cancellation by You</h3>
        <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings or by emailing <a href="mailto:help.remodely@gmail.com">help.remodely@gmail.com</a>. Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period. You will retain access to the Service until then.</p>

        <h3>Termination by Us</h3>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate your account if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You violate these Terms or our Acceptable Use policy.</li>
          <li>Your payment method fails and is not updated within 7 days.</li>
          <li>We are required to do so by law.</li>
          <li>We reasonably believe your use poses a security risk to the platform or other users.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will provide notice before termination when possible and give you the opportunity to export your data.</p>

        <h3>Effect of Termination</h3>
        <p>Upon termination, your right to use the Service ceases immediately. We will retain your data for 30 days to allow for export requests, after which it will be permanently deleted. Sections of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination (liability, indemnification, intellectual property, governing law) will continue to apply.</p>

        <h2 id="governing-law">14. Governing Law &amp; Disputes</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Arizona, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
        <p>Any disputes arising from these Terms or the Service shall be resolved as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Informal resolution:</strong> We will first attempt to resolve any dispute informally by contacting each other directly. Most issues can be resolved quickly this way.</li>
          <li><strong>Mediation:</strong> If informal resolution fails, either party may request mediation through a mutually agreed mediator in Maricopa County, Arizona.</li>
          <li><strong>Arbitration or litigation:</strong> If mediation fails, disputes shall be resolved through binding arbitration in Maricopa County, Arizona, or in the state or federal courts located in Maricopa County, Arizona, at the claimant's election.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You agree to bring any claim within one year of the event giving rise to the claim, or the claim is permanently waived.</p>

        <h2 id="changes-terms">15. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by email or by posting a notice on our website at least 30 days before the changes take effect. Your continued use of the Service after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. If you do not agree to the changes, you may cancel your subscription before the effective date.</p>

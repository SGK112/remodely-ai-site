## 1. Executive Summary

Remodely AI builds ready-to-deploy AI software for small businesses. Our platform bundles six core tools — AI Receptionist, Smart Scheduler, Instant Quotes, Client Portal, Payment System, and Review Engine — into a single subscription that replaces fragmented, expensive software stacks.

We started in the trades. We know what it's like to miss calls while on a job site, lose leads to slow follow-up, and spend nights doing invoices instead of growing the business. We built the software we wished existed.

**Key facts:**
- Target market: 33.2 million small businesses in the U.S.
- Initial vertical: Home services (remodeling, contracting, HVAC, plumbing, electrical, landscaping)
- Revenue model: Monthly SaaS subscriptions ($149–$499/month)
- Technology: OpenAI, Anthropic, Twilio, Stripe, Next.js, Python
- Stage: Pre-revenue, product built, site live
- Goal: 100 paying customers in Year 1, $300K ARR

---

## 2. Problem

Small business owners — especially in the trades — face a brutal operational reality:

### Missed Revenue
- **62% of calls** to small businesses go unanswered (Invoca, 2024)
- **85% of callers** who reach voicemail never call back
- A single missed call costs a contractor an average of **$1,200–$3,500** in lost revenue

### Software Overload
- The average small business uses **8–12 separate tools** for scheduling, invoicing, CRM, reviews, and communication
- Monthly software costs: **$500–$1,500+** across fragmented tools
- Most tools are designed for tech-savvy office workers, not tradespeople in the field

### Time Drain
- Owners spend **15–20 hours/week** on admin tasks: answering calls, sending quotes, chasing payments, responding to reviews
- That's time not spent on billable work or growing the business

### Quote Friction
- Manual quoting takes **24–72 hours** to turn around
- Customers often go with the first contractor who responds
- Speed-to-quote is the #1 factor in winning residential jobs

---

## 3. Solution

Remodely AI replaces the entire small business software stack with one AI-powered platform:

| Problem | Remodely AI Solution |
|---------|---------------------|
| Missed calls | AI Receptionist answers 24/7, captures leads, books appointments |
| Slow quotes | Instant Quotes generates estimates in minutes using customer-submitted details |
| Scheduling chaos | Smart Scheduler auto-books based on availability, travel time, and job type |
| No client visibility | Client Portal gives customers real-time project status, documents, and messaging |
| Payment delays | Payment System automates invoicing, deposits, and payment collection via Stripe |
| Unmanaged reputation | Review Engine monitors reviews, analyzes sentiment, and drafts responses |

**One login. One subscription. Six tools that work together.**

## 8. Competitive Landscape

### Indirect Competitors
- Generic CRMs (HubSpot, Salesforce) — too complex for tradespeople

### Competitive Moat
1. **Trade-specific AI:** Our AI understands remodeling terminology, scoping, and pricing
2. **All-in-one platform:** Competitors solve 1–2 problems; we solve 6
3. **Founder credibility:** Built by people from the trades, not Silicon Valley consultants
4. **Data advantage:** As we onboard more contractors, our pricing and scheduling AI improves

## Summary

Remodely AI is building the operating system for small service businesses. We combine AI voice agents, smart scheduling, instant quoting, client management, payments, and reputation management into one affordable platform.

We're not another Silicon Valley startup guessing what contractors need. We come from the trades. We've missed the calls, lost the leads, and done the invoices at midnight. We built this for ourselves first — and now we're building it for every small business owner who deserves better tools.

**Next step:** Get 5 pilot customers this month and prove the product works in the real world.

## Launch Day Social Media Templates

### LinkedIn Post (Day 1)
```
I just launched Remodely AI.

For the last [X months], I've been building AI software
for small businesses — starting with the trades.

Here's why:

I came from the trades. I know what it's like to miss calls
while you're on a ladder. To lose a $5,000 job because you
couldn't send a quote fast enough. To spend your nights doing
invoices instead of being with your family.

Remodely AI fixes that:
→ AI Receptionist answers every call 24/7
→ Instant Quotes in minutes, not days
→ Smart Scheduler books jobs automatically
→ Client Portal keeps customers informed
→ Payments collected on time, every time

We're offering free trials to the first 20 businesses
who want to try it.

Link in comments. Would love your feedback.

### Instagram Post
```
We're live. 🏠

Remodely AI — AI software built for the trades.

Never miss a call. Send quotes instantly.
Get paid on time.

Built by someone who's been on the job site.
Now building the tools we wished existed.

Free trial → link in bio

### Email to Personal Network
```
Subject: I built something — would love your feedback

Hey [Name],

I just launched a company called Remodely AI. We build AI
software for small businesses — think an AI that answers
your phone, sends quotes, schedules jobs, and collects
payments.

I'm starting with contractors and home service businesses
(the world I came from), but the tools work for any small
business.

Would you mind taking 2 minutes to check out the site?
https://remodely.ai

If you know anyone who runs a small business and is drowning
in phone calls and admin work, I'd love an introduction.

Thanks,
Joshua
